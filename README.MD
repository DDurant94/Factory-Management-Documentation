About:
  Factory Management is an advanced RESTful API that is robust and scalable for companies of all sizes. It is designed to allow businesses to monitor the production of products, employees, customers, and orders. With its modular design, this API can be easily scaled up, down, or extended. This ensures that clients, whether they are owners or customers, have smooth access to data. To interact with this Python API, go to the link under Postman where the data structure and endpoints are ready for interaction. All you need to do is set up a database in MySQL workbench and enter your password into config.py under SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI. For a deeper dive into this program, visit docs.txt.

  This project was built upon all other Factory Management API (<https://github.com/DDurant94/Factory-Management-API>). This version (V:1.0.4) focuses on documentation, utilizing Swagger to provide interactive and detailed examples of endpoints, as well as data inputs and outputs. This enhances readability and helps users understand how the API works and what to expect from each endpoint.
